# Text Classification with Naive Bayes

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The notebook is implemented using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.

The dataset used in this project is the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which contains approximately 20,000 newsgroup posts, partitioned into 20 different categories. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these newsgroup posts into their respective categories.

## Getting Started

To run the implementations, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* NLTK

You can install these libraries using pip. For example, to install NumPy, you can run the following command:

```
pip install nltk
```
Once you have installed the required libraries, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git. To do this, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/reeba212/Text-Classification-Naive-Bayes
```
To run the notebook, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. From here, you can open the notebook and run the cells to train and test the model.

## Result

After training the model on the newsgroups dataset, we achieved an accuracy of over 87% on the test set. This demonstrates that the model is effective at classifying articles in the newsgroups dataset.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical example of text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. By studying the notebook, you can gain a deeper understanding of how the algorithm works and how it can be applied to real-world problems. With this knowledge, you can extend the implementation or use it as a starting point for your own projects.
